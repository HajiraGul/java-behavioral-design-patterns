# Java Behavioral Design Patterns

This repository provides simple Java examples demonstrating several behavioral design patterns. These patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate. The examples are designed for educational purposes, providing clear and concise implementations.

## Patterns Included

*   **Iterator Pattern:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
*   **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Usage

Each pattern has its own package with a demo class containing a `main` method to run the example.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd [project directory]
    ```

3.  **Compile and run the examples (using a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, or from the command line):**

    **Command line:**
    ```bash
    javac <package name>/<file name>.java
    java <package name>/<file name>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    javac iteratorpatterndemo/IteratorPatternDemo.java
    java iteratorpatterndemo/IteratorPatternDemo
    ```
